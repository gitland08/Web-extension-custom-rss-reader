# Web-extension-custom-rss-reader

We will build a custom RSS Reader for the feed of the website https://archiveofourown.org/. Their default feed only shows new works, but not updates. To get the updates, we will have to create our own parser. 

For the first version, we will be adding the following features:
1. Add the default RSS feed as it is parsed by the general parser
2. Create a custom parser which shows new updates.
3. Create a “favourites” feature.
